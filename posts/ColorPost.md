Something that many, myself included, don't think about often enough is accessibility for the color-blind. I love using different pretty colors for everything. I would often use rainbows, galaxy, ocean background pictures, etc. Reds, pinks, and purples galore was my life moto with decorating. So of course I took this mind-set with me into decorating websites. Until my design class where we learned about accessibility and how using colors such as the ones I used could make it impossible for people that are color-blind to see anything properly on your site. 

I learned about using sites dedicated to showing how certain colors look to all the different color-blind types and how to pick the right colors for your site. It really made me realize how important it is when styling a website to be careful of the colors you pick. Making a site accessible to everyone could mean the difference in your site going over well with clients, or break your site and make clients rethink hiring you.

I also learned that blue is a very popular and easy color to use when trying to make your site accessible to colorblind people. It's a color that most people are able to see. Just a little fun fact for the day.
