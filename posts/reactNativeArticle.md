React Router is better than React Native. I know what you're thinking, "You can't say React Router is better or worse than React Native. That's like saying cars are better than boats". I know and understand that React Native is set up for mobile apps while React Router is set up for websites and creating api's. What I'm saying is that the way things are set up to be used in React Router compared to React Native is much more newbie friendly. With time would I get used to React Native and begin to love it? Absolutely! React by itself I absolutely hated in the beginning. When I got used to it - forced to continue to use it - it became much easier. Am I 100% used to it yet? Not by a long shot. What's the point of the comparison? Great question, side rambling over let's focus on the main points. 

React Router, as everyone that works with it knows, wasn't built with mobile friendliness in mind. Not in the way that React Native was at least. React Native, in conjunction with Xcode, worked so wonderfully together. It was so nice to see my work on a mobile device. Even literally, if you download their app and connect it to your code with the scanner. Features like that make React Native stand out from their competitors. Especially, when you add in the documentation on their site. It's extremely easy to follow.

If it's so wonderful then you must be thinking, "How is it so bad?" Even with how great the documentation is, it's an absolute nightmare to get the thing to work well. I don't think the great minds behind React meant for it to be this difficult. Adding in images to React Router is so simple. And while React Native does have documentation for images and how to use them, good luck actually getting it to work. I have first hand knowledge of struggling with it. To be fair, I didn't spend days researching how to make them work like I normally would. Internet + the middle of nowhere = no internet. Even so, in React Router it didn't take days of research. In fact, it took mere hours at the most. Messing around with the code and voila beautiful images. Did that easy use maybe come from the fact I'd spent time researching it in a previous class? ...kind of. 

To be fair, the background I researched how to do was a headache originally in React Router just as much as it was in React Native. So, what's the difference? The scale level of how much my head hurt after dealing with it. Figuring out how to make React Router work with a background image came much simpler to me because I used my head and thought through how I knew how to do it in normal coding situations. React Native was a whole other beast that even my most knowledgable friend in coding said, "Don't even attempt it. That's way to hard and high above your skill level. That would take way more time than you have available and not worth it in the end". So I gave it up, for now. You know me, when I have an idea in my head of how a site should look I won't give up until I figure out how to make it work. That and when I see a challenge I can't stop until I accomplish and defeat the challenge.

My point in all of this? Yes, React Router and React Native are two different beasts with two different main goals in mind. React Router is about setting up api's and deploying websites through netlify, github pages, etc. React Native is about creating and deploying through apps. So how can you compare the two if they are different? By how user friendly they are. The way React Router was set up to be used versus how React Router was set up to be used differ greatly. Both are amazing, and with time my opinion may even change to loving React Native more. As of right now, my blog is about why React Router was so much easier to set up. The way React Router works is very similar to how anything in React or even in other coding formats works. It's easier because it's familiar. React Native is a whole other harder beast to tame, because - while somewhat similar and uses great documentation - it is also highly different. Even with documentation, getting images to show properly was impossible. In React Router the images took no time at all for me to figure out and use immediately. 

My heel to die on will upset many, but as of right now that is my stance. I plan to learn as much as I can about React Native and grow as a developer using it in the future, because despite these very minor flaws, React Native is amazing. But even minor flaws can be seen as a huge negative to many. For me, the images not showing, and the many different ways I tried through the documentation, just ended up with me disappointed in my work. I hope to change that in the future, but as of right now React Router looks to be supreme in my eyes.
