The biggest question is how much time do you have? Seriously, because you won't learn this in a day. In fact, how much hair do you have and how much do you want to keep. I'm not kidding. I know a guy that became a student and literally pulled his hair on multiple occasions trying to learn this stuff. 

Don't run!

I promise it's worth it. If you really want it. If you just want a website and to move on with your life. Definitely run to someone else and pay them to do it. Saves you a lot of money in a degree, saves you time, and potentially saves your hair.

All jokes aside, if you really want to be a developer there are some key things you need to know and add to your work life motto. 

 - Errors are a part of website building life, learn to understand them and you'll do well. Prepare to deal with them daily. Just when you think you've dealt with one, another one pops up. It can be frustrating, but it's part of the job. 
 - Google will become your new spouse. I'm not kidding, I spend more time talking to Google about my work than I do my friends or family. Of course, my family is happy to not have to listen to me speak in *tongue*, according to them.
 - Bookmark everything you use. I have bookmarks for so many sites. I highly recommend making bookmarks for command prompts, a color picker, and Google Fonts. I don't recommend w3schools or MDN. Instead, I will actually say you have to have them. Recommendations are choices. w3schools and MDN are a must for learning to develop and continuing to develop. Of course, that's my opinion.
 - Figure out what path you want to go. 
   - If you don't know what kind of Developer you want to be then how are you supposed to start learning? Do you want to go to school or learn it on your own? If you go with learning it on your own I highly recommend boot camp. You'll struggle completely by yourself and bootcamp can be a great option for people with little to no funds for a higher education. If you choose the school route you'll most likely be taught everything there is. Which means back-end, front-end, design, security, and the list goes on and on. 
 - One many don't consider: Where do you want to live? It's more important than you think. Based on the pay, some places actually pay better than others. Some places have such a high cost of living and low cost of pay in the job that it's not worth even going there. If your plan has always been to live somewhere really remote far away from society, I have no idea why you are here. I definitely don't recommend it because you need internet, and I speak from experience living remotely. Good luck finding internet. It can work, but in some places it's highly unlikely.


All in all, there is a lot to consider when thinking about becoming a Developer. While it can be rewarding monetarily or otherwise, it's not easy. It's sometimes so frustrating that I want to throw my computer away and go lay down until I calm down. Many times in the same day. If it's something you really enjoy, regardless of the pain and suffering that comes with it, it's worth looking into and becoming a developer. Know this very important thing before you go into it.

You will question everything. What I mean is: You'll question all of your life choise up to that moment and even question giving up. You'll ask yourself if your just not meant to be a developer. Don't give up! I think I can speak on the behalf of literally every developer and programmer out there when I say we've all been there. It's exhausting, depressing, and makes you wonder if you just aren't cut out for it. You are and you can get through it. I struggle still and I continue to push forward and keep trucking. Why? Because my degree is expensive and I refuse to waste money. Oh, and because I love creating code. Seriously, I really do love coding. It's the one thing I've found that, no matter how much I want to chuck it out the window, I still come back to it wanting to code more and finish what I was doing. It's hard but it's highly rewarding when you finish it.
