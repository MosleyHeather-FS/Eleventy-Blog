Javascript will be here forever. Much to my disappointment, or that's what I thought when I first got started. JavaScript is a beast of a language that isn't the easiest to master. When you do though? It makes life so much easier. Why? Because no matter what program you work in, which job you apply for, or what company you work for you will undoubtedly be using JavaScript. In fact, different articles online speculate it getting more popular in the future. According to Andre Reales from <a href="{{ 'https://www.becomebetterprogrammer.com/javascript-obsolete-and-future/' | url }">Become A Better Programmer</a>, "**JavaScript is not likely to become obsolete anytime soon. While newer languages are starting to gain traction, JavaScript will continue to dominate in web development. Itâ€™s a universal language that can be used for front-end and back-end development, making it an essential skill for developers.**". 

They go on to explain how JavaScript is so much more than just a language. It's the powerhouse of the internet that actually runs a lot of different video, gaming, and shopping based websites. Without JavaScript to run those machines none of those games or videos would work, and they are right. 

Anyone else remember playing Minecraft back when it was on java's site and seeing the JavaScript version showing right beside the play button? Just me? 

JavaScript has been around since 1995. 1995! That's 27 years in a tech industry where things are constantly being updated and changed every other year, if not every year.

So how is it surviving?

Well it certainly doesn't hurt that almost everything uses it, if not literally everything on the web at least. Although Ruby and Python certainly have become popular and a lot of people use them, a lot of big name libraries and frameworks still work off of JavaScript. One of things Reales states for why it's still so popular and will continue to be for a while, is how easy it is to learn. I personally disagree with that, but I do agree that it being open-source makes it extremely versatile and it's long history of popularity means there is no end to the amount of helpful articles, tips, and videos you can find online to help you through any errors you have using it.

It has it's flaws, no one knows that better than me and the other students that pulled their hair trying to learn how to use it. But it's relevant because it's better and will always be the go to for many people. Sorry Ruby and Python, JavaScript is the winner in this case. Try again next year!
