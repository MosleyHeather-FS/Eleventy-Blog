On PodRocket's podcast they talked about Remix and React Router. The host of the podcast, Ben Edelstein, spoke to the creator of Remix, Michael Jackson. Not the Michael Jackson you're thinking. Just to make that clear. Michael Jackson didn't fool anyone or come back to life like some zombie monster from Thriller, I promise. This guy is the co-creator of React Router. He's big in the open source area of Web Development. 

To start with I want to say I've never heard of Remix before this podcast. Obviously, React is a big name and React-Router because of React. It surprised me at first when he explained how he and others that worked on React had assumed and expected people to take the nested routes that React has and build off of it in a more enhanced way. It shocked me in many ways, mostly in the way he said it. It sounded almost as if he was wanting to put it out there to inspire others and watch how people in the Web Development community would create their own inspired works from it. He talked about how he'd been disappointed in not seeing what he had hoped to see, and thus Remix was born.

He went on to explain how Remix basically was created to help fix a lot of what React was missing. They would have so many people using it to create their own websites and apps, but then run into some pretty important/serious problems. One I personally experienced and makes me want to use Remix to see if it will help me fix that: lack of deployment. Jackson said that they had many people concerned with the fact there is no way to deploy their personal creations in React. Remix was created, not to deploy for you, but to make it easier for the people creating websites and apps through React to deploy their creations themselves. He said that Remix works well on and non-node environments and node environments. One example that caught my eye: Netlify. 

Remix was created to better enhance the user's ability to to design and deploy their React apps/websites. It really all relies and depends on nested routing, the very thing that makes React so great in the first place. Now, Remix is just coming in to help make React better basically. Something that I'm personally exited to try myself now. React is wonderful, but it can be such a headache as well. Especially with deploys. The React co-founder himself saying they've made something bigger and better to help with that? Well, you've got my attention. I'm all for giving it a whirl. Maybe, it'll be the next best thing to hit since they made React.
